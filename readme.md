# AI-Powered Nutrition Advisor

## Description
This project is a prototype application that helps users make **smarter dietary choices**.  
Users can input their daily meals, and the system analyzes the **nutritional content** (calories, proteins, fats, vitamins, etc.) and provides **personalized health recommendations**.  

The aim is to build an **AI-powered tool** that makes nutrition guidance simple, accessible, and personalized.

## Features
- Input meals in text form (e.g., "2 chapatis, dal, salad").
- Analyze meal nutrition using a food dataset.
- Flag imbalances or deficiencies.
- Suggest healthier alternatives or improvements.
- Simple frontend for user input & backend for processing.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django)  
- **Database:** CSV / Open nutrition dataset  
- **AI/Logic:** Rule-based nutrition analysis

## Status
This is an **initial prototype** created for learning and GitHub practice.  
The project will be improved further by adding more food items, better analysis, and AI-based meal planning.
